# Quick Answer: Can We Use Swap Space?

## Question

Since there's not enough RAM (80GB available, ~120GB needed for Tier 5), can we configure swap space to prevent OOM errors?

## Short Answer

**No, swap space won't solve the problem.** Here's why:

## Three Main Reasons

### 1. ‚ùå SLURM Limits Include Swap

The `#SBATCH --mem=80G` directive limits **total memory (RAM + Swap)**, not just RAM.

```bash
#SBATCH --mem=80G    # This = 80GB total, not 80GB RAM + extra swap
```

Even if the node has swap, you still can't exceed 80GB total.

### 2. ‚ùå Performance Would Be Terrible

Swap is **100-1000x slower** than RAM:

| Operation | With RAM | With Swap | Result |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Matrix operations | Fast | 100x slower | Unusable |
| Spatial joins | Slow | 1000x slower | **Extremely slow** |
| 24-hour job | 24 hours | 240+ hours | **Would timeout** |

### 3. ‚ùå HPC Systems Disable Swap

Most HPC systems (including likely AIMS) have **zero swap** configured because:
- Prevents performance unpredictability
- Prevents one user from impacting others
- Maintains fair resource allocation

## How to Check

Run this on the HPC:

```bash
# Upload and run the resource checker
./check_hpc_resources.sh

# Or manually check
free -h
swapon --show
```

**Expected result**: No swap available

## What To Do Instead

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Use Tier 4 (BEST)

```bash
sbatch run_hpc_tier4.slurm
```

- Memory: ~70GB (safe)
- Success rate: ~95%
- Speed: Fast
- Resolution: Still good

### ‚úÖ Solution 2: Use Model Type 5

```bash
# Edit script: change --model_type=6 to --model_type=5
sbatch run_hpc_optimised.slurm
```

- Reduces memory by ~20-30%
- Tier 5 might become feasible

### ‚úÖ Solution 3: Process Stages Separately

Break the analysis into multiple smaller jobs:
- Job 1: Load data (~40GB)
- Job 2: Process data (~60GB)
- Job 3: Fit model (~80GB)

### ‚úÖ Solution 4: Use Cloud VM

Rent a VM with 128GB+ RAM:
- AWS EC2 (r6i.4xlarge: 128GB RAM)
- Azure (E16 v5: 128GB RAM)
- Google Cloud (n2-highmem-16: 128GB RAM)

Cost: ~$2-5/hour for high-memory instances

## Why These Are Better Than Swap

| Approach | Speed | Reliability | Available Now |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Swap space** | üêå Very slow | ‚ùå Won't work | ‚ùå No |
| **Tier 4** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚úÖ Reliable | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Model Type 5** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Staged jobs** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Cloud VM** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚úÖ Reliable | ‚úÖ Yes |

## Bottom Line

**Don't waste time trying to configure swap.** It won't help and would make things slower even if it worked.

**Use Tier 4 instead** - it will complete successfully in 18-36 hours with good results.

## More Details

See comprehensive analysis: `SWAP_SPACE_ANALYSIS.md`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check what's available
./check_hpc_resources.sh

# Use the recommended approach
sbatch run_hpc_tier4.slurm

# Monitor progress
tail -f reefcloud_tier4_<JOB_ID>.out
```

**Result**: Successful analysis without memory issues. ‚úÖ
