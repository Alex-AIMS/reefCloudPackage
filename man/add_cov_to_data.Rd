\title{Add covariates to data}
\usage{
add_cov_to_data(data, cov, cov_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the monitoring data (including fields like `Tier5`, `REPORT_YEAR`, `DATE`, etc.)}

\item{cov}{A data frame containing the extracted disturbance layer values by year and `Tier5` spatial unit}

\item{cov_name}{A string naming the disturbance layer, used to construct column names such as `severity_[name]`}
}
\value{
A data frame with added and adjusted covariate columns: 
`severity_[name]`, `max_[name]`, and their lagged versions for 1 and 2 years.
}
\description{
This function merges a covariate layer (typically representing disturbance) with monitoring data. 
It adjusts covariate values based on the timing of the surveys, computes lagged versions of the 
covariate (e.g., 1-year and 2-year lags), and handles missing values by replacing them with 0.

The adjustment logic ensures that if the disturbance occurred after the survey date, 
the covariate value from the previous year is used instead.

# Example usage:
# data <- readRDS("monitoring_data.rds")
# cov <- readRDS("disturbance_layer.rds")
# data_with_cov <- add_cov_to_data(data, cov, cov_name = "cyclone")
