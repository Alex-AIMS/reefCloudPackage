\usage{
model_processData()
}
\description{
This function is the main entry point for processing benthic data 
used in the modelling pipeline. It performs the following steps:

1. Loads the primary benthic data from an `.RData` file.
2. Optionally processes legacy benthic data if available.
3. Routes the data processing logic depending on whether the 
   analysis is targeting a site-level model (INLA) or a tier-level 
   model (FRK).
The processed datasets are saved into the `processed/` folder for use 
in later modelling steps. Logging and error handling are managed by 
the `status` package to track the data pipeline.
The function requires the `DATA_PATH`, `RDATA_FILE`, `DOMAIN_CATEGORY`, 
and optionally `LEGACY_DATA` global variables to be set. These control 
file paths and the type of model being run.
