\title{Process Benthic and Covariate Data at Tier Level}
\usage{
model_processDataTier()
}
\description{
Loads benthic monitoring data (including legacy sources), assigns each record
to spatial Tier levels, prepares data for modelling (e.g., by survey date and
benthic group), and integrates spatial covariates from the geoserver.

This function is typically used in workflows preparing data for either:
- Simple hierarchical INLA models (site-based)
- Full spatiotemporal FRK models (tier-based)
}
\details{
Steps include:
- Retrieving and merging benthic datasets
- Spatially joining Tier levels (Tier 1â€“5)
- Preparing tier lookup tables
- Aggregating and summarising benthic photo point data by relevant groupings
- Preparing covariates from geospatial layers
